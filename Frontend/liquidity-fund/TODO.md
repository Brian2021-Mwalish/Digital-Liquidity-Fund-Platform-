# KYC Form Update Tasks

## Current Task: Update KYC Form with Green Theme, Animations, and Distinguishable Inputs

### Steps to Complete:
1. **Edit KYCForm.jsx**:
   - Replace primary color classes with dark green equivalents (e.g., bg-green-800, text-green-800).
   - Add animations: animate-in for form sections, hover effects on buttons, pulse for loading states.
   - Make inputs distinguishable: Add green borders on focus (border-green-500), subtle green background (bg-green-50), and shadows.
   - Ensure all styling is within the component code using Tailwind classes.

2. **Test Changes**:
   - Run the development server to verify the green theme is applied.
   - Check animations are working (e.g., form fade-in, button hover).
   - Confirm inputs are visually distinct when focused.

### Notes:
- All styling must remain within KYCForm.jsx code.
- Use Tailwind's green color palette for consistency.
- Keep the rest of the functionality unchanged.
